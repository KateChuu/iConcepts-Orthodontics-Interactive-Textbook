                    Bruxism if not managed over a period of time can lead to excessive tooth wear, loss of smile arc (aged look), loss of vertical freeway space which in turn overloads the temporomandibular joint causing TMD (Temporo-Mandibular Disorder), and affecting the quality of sleep. 
                    Hence, splint therapy is commonly prescribed for chronic Bruxism. 
                    However, over a period of months the splint due to heavy masticatory loading can fracture requiring repeated replacements which is neither ideal nor sustainable. 
                    Furthermore, many 3D printed splints can discolour and loose the initial fabrication fit. 
                    Hence, we need better solutions in 2025 and provide patients with active splints that re-create the lost freeway space that is essential for oral-dental health and well being and prevent vertical dimension loss.

                    Pietkiewicz(1) first introduced the term Bruxism to the scientific community in 1907. 
                    In 1966, Ash and Ramjford used the labels centric and eccentric Bruxism as two main categories of Bruxism and pointed out that most severe Bruxism usually occurs at night. 
                    Bruxism is defined, as <span className="italic">“forcible clenching or grinding of the teeth or a combination of both”</span>, requiring treatment Ash and Ramjford. 
                    To date, the etiology of sleep Bruxism remains rather elusive. 
                    Three major hypothesized causes of sleep Bruxism are neurological factors, peripheral stimulus and psychogenic elements. 
                    Recently sleep Bruxism has come to be considered to be primarily induced centrally (2).

                    A 2013 systematic review of the literature identified several large survey studies that reported a Bruxism prevalence range of 8% to 31.4%. 
                    The prevalence of sleep Bruxism in children is between 14% and 20%, in young persons between the age of 18 and 29 it is 13%, in adults it is 9%, and in persons over age 65 it is 3% (Abe and Shimakawa 1966 (3); Okeson et al 1990(4)). 
                    Self-reported and reliance on sleep partners to report the presence of Bruxism probably leads to underestimation of the actual prevalence of the condition, due to the occurrence of Bruxism during sleep(5). 
                    Bruxism is frequently associated with Down syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, headaches, and Rett syndrome as well as restlessness(6), hyperactivity, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (DeMattei et al 2007(7); Fonseca et al 2011(8)). 
                    Bruxism seems to be more common among late versus early postmenopausal women Hachul et al 2009(9).

                    The maximum biting force of patients who brux is greater than average due to the excessive clenching of the muscles of mastication. 
                    For bruxers, loads on the teeth may exceed 35.18 Kg/cm2 (3450 kPa) with sometimes maximum bite force greater than 69.59 kg/cm2 (6825 kPa, four to seven times above normal) Okeson JP, Phillips BA, Berry DT, Cook Y et al. 1990 (4). 
                    Bruxism may affect the teeth, muscles, joints, bone, implants, and/or the prostheses, these forces may occur while the patient is awake or asleep, and may be present for several hours per day. 
                    Range of management suggested for treatment of Bruxism includes behavioral intervention(4), dental and pharmacological interventions (10, 11), and use of oral appliances Ash and Ramfjord S. 1966  with bite splints having positive effects on patient&apos;s dental health (12) by preventing tooth wear. 
                    Moreover, Bruxism or grinding of teeth is a dental problem encountered more often recently than previously reported, infact also observed in young children(13). 
                    The issue is multifactorial, e.g.  mostly stress, implicated to fast paced video games and constant online stimulation Klasser et al 2015(6) Oliveira et al 2015(14) Wiekiewicz (15).

                   There are different approaches to management of Bruxism. 
                   Various methods have been suggested for treatment of sleep Bruxism such as occlusal adjustment splint therapy psychological treatment  Pietkiewicz M.1907. , Attitudinal Healing Approaches (16) and medical treatment (17). 
                   Currently occlusal splints (soft or hard type) are mainly used during sleep, not to suppress Bruxism but to reduce as much as possible the harmful effects on the stomatognathic system(18) predominantly enamel and dental wear through attrition. 
                   Bruxism if not addressed or managed over a period of time can lead to excessive tooth wear, loss of smile arc, loss of vertical freeway space that in turn can overload the temporomandibular joint to cause disorders (TMD) which in turn affects the quality of sleep (19). 
                   Hence, splint therapy is commonly prescribed for chronic Bruxism. 
                   But over a period of months the splint due to heavy masticatory loading can fracture and new ones are needed  adding to cost  time and money. 
                   Moreover, gingival recession associated with  bulky splint digging over a period of time particularly in the maxillary canine regions. 
                   During the research commercialization phase 100+ customer / patient insights (anonymized) showed dissatisfaction with available methods for management of Bruxism at Translating Research at Melbourne University.

                    Diagnosis of Bruxism at chair side by observing wear facets on the upper and lower teeth match in excursive movements, maxillary incisors are all the same length with flat broad incisal edges, flat shiny areas on the cusps of posterior teeth, or by significant number of fracture lines around small posterior teeth. 
                    Self-reporting is usually the most obvious way of confirming the condition. 
                    Currently the heat maps in contemporary intra-oral scanners make occlusal loading more obvious.

                    The possibility of suppressing sleep Bruxism through audio, vibrational (20), and stimulation have been reported as electrical stimulation of the lips (21) suggesting that stimulation of the trigeminal nerve area may actively suppress sleep Bruxism. 
                    However, these are mostly in trials and not available for main stream treatment.
