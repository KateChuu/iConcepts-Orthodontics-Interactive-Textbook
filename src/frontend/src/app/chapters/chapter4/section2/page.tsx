          CLARK TWIN BLOCK
        </h3>
        <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200 mb-1">
          The most user friendly and comfortable functional appliance was
          devised by Clark in 1982. It has become the most popular functional
          appliance in the U.K. The Clark Twin Block (CTB) is excellent for the
          treatment of severe Class II / 1 with spectacular results. Class II /
          2 can also be treated provided the malocclusion is free of crowding. A
          Class III version of CTB is also available, but is not very promising
          due to the reasons mentioned in biomechanics. It is satisfactorily
          used in mixed or permanent dentition. In a co-operative patient it
          shows marvellous results in 3-6 months of treatment. The major
          limitation of CTB is that it is not successful in deep bite cases as
          eruption of the posterior teeth are prevented. See Gallery 2.5 case.

        <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200 mb-1">
          Unlike other conventional functional appliances, CTB, as the name
          implies comes in two independent parts - one for the maxillary arch
          and one for the mandibular. The two parts have inclined planes which
          meet and cause the mandible to be postured forward on closure for
          correction of Class II malocclusion.

          Upper Twin of CTB
        </h3>
        <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200 mb-1">
          It is similar to the conventional URA with molar capping with bite
          blocks. The bite block is limited to the posterior end of the arch
          with an inclined plane at 70º on the mesial end. This engages a similar
          slope in the lower twin. A midline screw is incorporated to produce
          upper arch expansion as antero-posterior jaw relationship is
          corrected. Special Delta clasps or conventional Adam&apos;s cribs can
          be used on <span className="underline">6 4 / 4 6</span> for enhanced retention. If 4s have not erupted Ds
          are clasped. Historically short coils or Flying EOTs are incorporated for attaching
          the face bow of the head gear. Finally, anterior retention is provided
          by a labial bow.

          Lower Twin of CTB
        </h3>
        <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200 mb-1">
          Again similar to the lower removable appliance. It takes retention
          from Adam&apos;s cribs on  <span className="underline">6 4 / 4 6</span> and special ball ended clasps in
          between the lower central and lateral incisors. In order to prevent
          lower labial segment proclination, a labial bow, Southend clasp or
          acrylic incisal capping can be used. The bite blocks are restricted to
          premolar regions only in the lower appliance. The bite blocks are
          usually 7.0 mm thick.

        <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200 mb-1">
          Soft modeling wax is placed onto the Project® or wooden sticks with
          midline mark. Historically the mandible is postured forward almost in an
          edge-to-edge occlusion. An opening of 5-7mm is usually sufficient. If
          overjet is massive it is best to protrude the mandible half way and
          later either construct another CTB or activate the existing appliance
          with cold cure acrylic on the inclined plane of the lower twin. At the
          time of writing digital 3D printing provide greater precision and
          ease and bite registration.
