                Functional appliances work by utilizing functional forces of muscles of mastication and facial expression, to bring about favorable
                changes in skeletal and dental relationship mostly in antero-posterior dimension, along with vertical and transverse
                corrections as well. Majority are removable, but fixed functional appliances are also available.

                    The first inclined plane was used in the 19th century. Robin&apos;s Monobloc was developed in 1902 to prevent glossoptosis in neonates suffering from Pierre Robin Syndrome. This appliance was modified by
                    Andresen in 1930s, and was used for the first time on his very own daughter. She had a mild skeletal II base. Andresen provided her
                    with what was later termed as <strong>Andresen or Norwegian appliance.</strong> With night time use only when she went off to summer camp as instructed
                    by her Dad, there was a marked improvement in the profile when she returned. Thus, this opened a new horizon of improving profiles and
                    occlusions through re-education of orofacial musculature. A large number of functional appliances were developed thereafter, usually named after the innovator.

                    A large number of functional appliances are available to the Orthodontist today. The choice is largely a personal one depending
                    upon the preference and familiarity of the specialist, as the mode of action of all is very similar apart from a few special
                    circumstances. Other factors determining the choice of a functional appliance are buccal or lingual shields and lip pads, laboratory facilities, economic constraints and degree
                    of compliance of the patient. The following is a list of different functional appliances:

                    The functional appliances produce dentoalveolar and skeletal modification along with guiding eruption of the dentition and
                    improving the soft tissue profile. It is known that the overjet reduction in Class II cases occurs primarily due to tipping of
                    teeth. The molar relationship is corrected from Class II to Class I through guidance of eruption by specific acrylic trimming e.g. in
                    Andresen appliance. Perhaps the most important contribution is the skeletal modification, which is increased growth rate of the
                    retrognathic mandible. Marschner and Harris (1966) saw an increase of 1.5mm/year in the mandibular growth in 9-10 year old and 1mm/year
                    increase in 10-12 year olds. The mandibular direction of growth can be altered principally in the vertical direction. Hence, it is
                    particularly beneficial for short faces. Restraint has been found difficult and unsuccessful in Class III increased mandibular size
                    cases. In maxilla on the other hand restraint is easier to produce, but to promote maxillary growth has been unsuccessful. Hence,
                    functional appliances are ideal of Class II skeletal malocclusions, but not for Class III skeletal cases.
