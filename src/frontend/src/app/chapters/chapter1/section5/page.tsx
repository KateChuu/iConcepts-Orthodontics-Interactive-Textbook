                PREVALENCE OF MALOCCLUSION
            </h2>
            <p>
                Prevalence of malocclusion in general human population is taken from U.S Public Health Service Survey conducted on a large scale in 1970. 
                It is important to realize that distribution of malocclusion types varies among racial, national and ethnic groups and even more complex with miscegenation, 
                hence be aware of the norms applied in the past. Caucasian data is presented in the table across.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">INCREASED PREVALENCE OF MALOCCLUSION</h3>
            <p>
                There are several reasons for increased prevalence of malocclusion. Firstly, and perhaps the most important being reduced function of masticatory apparatus. 
                In the past hard and fibrous foods were ingested, but today children hardly get the opportunity to chew – most of them are given processed meals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second reason quoted is the evolutionary trend. There has been steady reduction in the size of anterior and posterior teeth, along with their numbers. 
                The third incisors, third premolars and fourth molars have disappeared. At present the human third molars, second premolars and second incisors often fail to develop. 
                Like high blood pressure, heart diseases, diabetes – malocclusion is termed the “Disease of Civilization”. Moreover, OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea) and Bruxism 
                have been also added into the disease of civilization.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">DEMAND OF ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT</h3>
            <p>
                Demand for Orthodontic treatment is indicated by the number of patients who actually make appointments and seek care. 
                Orthodontics is no longer just confined to the child population and adolescents. Adults are now seeking Orthodontic treatment. 
                In a survey conducted in 1989 in USA, just over 25% of new patients were age 18 or older. 
                Orthodontics has become a prominent part of Dentistry in recent years and this trend is likely to continue in the socially aesthetic-conscious world we live in today. 
                However, it is also important to provide complete information regarding risk and benefit ratios to patients demanding unrealistic ideal occlusions 
                that have limitations in long term stability.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Definition</h3>
            <p>
                It is defined on the basis of the first permanent molar relationship i.e. mesio-buccal cusp of the upper first permanent molar lies in the mid-buccal groove 
                of the lower first permanent molar (Angle’s Classification).
            </p>
            <p>
                While the incisor classification is such that the lower incisal edge lies on or below the cingulum plateau of the palatal surface of the upper incisors.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Incidence</h3>
            <p>
                55–60% of the population is found to have Class I malocclusion (Todd & Dodd 1975).
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Clinical Features of Class I Malocclusion</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Skeletal:</strong><br />
                Generally the Class I malocclusion will be found on a skeletal I base. However, mild Class II or Class III skeletal bases with dento-alveolar compensations are not rare to find. 
                Overall the skeletal pattern is favourable.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Soft Tissues:</strong><br />
                The soft tissue profile is pleasing and lips, tongue and cheek pressures are well balanced.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Dental</h3>
            <p>
            Malocclusion is usually caused by local dental factors alone. <strong>Crowding</strong> is the most common problem, 
            which may be due to local factors or premature loss of deciduous units. <strong>Spacing</strong> can also occur, 
            but is generally rare. Most common reasons being tooth-jaw size discrepancy, fleshy frenum, missing teeth, 
            malformed teeth etc. <strong>Bimaxillary proclination</strong> is more a racial variant. 
            Care should be taken to diagnose the exact cause. <strong>Vertical anomalies</strong> such as anterior openbites 
            may also occur in Class I malocclusions, thus the Class I incisor relationship does not imply them. 
            <strong>Transverse Anomalies</strong> commonly present with crossbites and scissors bite.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Facial Growth Pattern</h3>
            <p>
            The growth pattern for Class I subjects is usually favorable. Although, it must be borne in mind that vertical 
            discrepancy such as an anterior openbite tends to get worse with further growth, 
            as dento-alveolar compensation is already at its limits.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">TREATMENT OPTIONS</h3>
            <p>
            Apart from functional appliances and Orthognathic surgery per se, the other 3 treatment modalities i.e.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-2">
            <li className="text-pink-500 font-bold">Clear Aligner Therapy</li>
            <li className="text-pink-500 font-bold">Fixed appliances</li>
            <li className="text-pink-500 font-bold">Removable appliances</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            are the most commonly applied treatment mechanics for Class I malocclusions. Various etiologic factors shall be discussed in detail.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Crowding</h3>
            <p>
            In a significant proportion of Class I cases, the only feature of malocclusion is crowding. 
            Where dental crowding alone is responsible for malocclusion with no other local factor, such as crossbites etc., 
            it may be possible to treat in limited number of cases without any appliance through timely extraction of teeth alone. 
            Serial extraction was one such extraction protocol used extensively in the past, 
            but has lost much application in present day Orthodontics as young patients are not subjected to repeated extractions routinely.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Extractions for Class I malocclusion</strong><br />
            In a crowded case, general guidelines for extractions are:<br />
            If the space discrepancy is up to 4mm, it is usually resolved without extractions (except third molars).
            </p>
            <p>
            Discrepancy in the range of 5–9mm are best treated without extractions by:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-2">
            <li>Arch expansion</li>
            <li>Molar anchorage TAD (Temporary Anchorage Devices)</li>
            <li>Enamel reduction IPR (InterProximal Reduction)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Patients with space discrepancy of 10mm or more almost always require premolar extractions with reinforced anchorage. 
            Other extraction patterns are asymmetrical and single ectopic dental units. 
            In certain crowded cases with premature loss of primary teeth, space maintainers may be required to ensure the space for permanent successor. 
            However, such cases always require two-phase orthodontic treatment. 
            Patients should be made aware of future full scope to make an informed decision.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Spacing</h3>
            <p>
            In Class I case with spacing, the decision has to be made whether to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-2">
            <li>Open spaces and place prosthesis for missing dental units</li>
            <li>Close space with appliance therapy to reduce restorative cycle in future</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            If spacing is excessive, then it is best to close generalized spacing and concentrate on the space where a prosthesis such as a bridge, 
            partial denture or acid etch bridge can be placed. 
            The major problem is to maintain such prosthesis throughout life, especially in children who have a whole life ahead of them, 
            affecting quality of life and the cost incurred with frequent replacements. 
            To close spaces is perhaps the best option, but can only be done with spacing that is not too gross. 
            However, aesthetics may be compromised e.g. when a missing lateral incisor space is closed with a more bulkier 
            and yellow shaded canine tooth in the maxillary arch.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Bimaxillary Proclination</h3>
            <p>
            Concomitant proclination of upper and lower labial dental units is usually racial i.e. common feature in Afro-Caribbean, Orientals, 
            and Negroid population and is best left untreated. However, if treatment is required to improve facial aesthetics and reduce overjet 
            or enhance lip competence, it is essential to assess each case on its own merits i.e. soft tissue like flaccid or everted lips or skeletal pattern. 
            Usually, these cases are treated with extractions of premolars in crowded cases, 
            but it is important to note that extractions should not be done only for incisor retraction, 
            as long-term response is poor and risk of overjet returning and reopening the extraction space is always present. 
            Best long-term stability is seen with joint Orthodontic and Orthognathic approach in severe skeletal cases.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Vertical Anomalies</h3>
            <p>
                The most common vertical anomaly in Class I malocclusion is the Anterior Open Bite (AOB).
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Definition</h3>
            <p>
                Condition where upper incisor crowns fail to overlap the incisal third of the lower incisor crowns when the mandible is brought into full occlusion (Mizrahi 1978).
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Etiology</h3>
            <p>It is broadly divided into:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
                <li>Genetic: inherent cant of the maxillary plane, increased vertical dimension of the mandibular plane.</li>
                <li>Environmental: habits like digit sucking (more common).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Environmental</h3>
            <p>
                Includes prolonged oral habits, abnormal tongue function, trauma/pathology involving condyle, neurological disturbances, or iatrogenic causes like extrusion of molars.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Classification</h3>
            <p>Anterior Open Bite (AOB) can be classified as:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
                <li>Skeletal</li>
                <li>Dental</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Clinical Features of Skeletal AOB</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Extra-Oral:</strong> long face, incompetent lips, steep FMPA, ante-gonial notch, and altered facial height ratios. <br />
                <strong>Intra-Oral:</strong> mild crowding, upright incisors, or only posterior occlusion. Mouth breathing common.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Clinical Features of Dental AOB</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Extra-Oral:</strong> generally normal appearance. <br />
                <strong>Intra-Oral:</strong> habit-related changes like proclined upper incisors, narrow maxillary arch, fish mouth appearance.
            </p>

            {/* Image: Anterior Open Bite  */}
            {/* ex: <img src="/path/to/image.jpg" alt="AOB Clinical Photo" className="w-full my-4" /> */}

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Treatment Options</h3>
            <p>
                Dental AOB: treatable with fixed appliances. Habit-breaking appliances (e.g., tongue cribs) are often used. <br />
                Recent advancements include magnetic bite blocks. Severe skeletal AOBs require Orthodontic + Orthognathic treatment.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4">Transverse Anomalies</h3>
            <p>
                Crossbites or scissors bite in Class I cases can be corrected via maxillary expansion:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
                <li>URA with midline expansion screw</li>
                <li>Quad Helix</li>
                <li>RME (Rapid Maxillary Expansion)</li>
                <li>TAD-based expansion systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                URAs are useful for occlusal interferences with bite blocks. Quad Helix/RME are often used with fixed appliances. 
                Bilateral, functionally stable crossbites may not require correction (Harradine & Birnie, 1998).
