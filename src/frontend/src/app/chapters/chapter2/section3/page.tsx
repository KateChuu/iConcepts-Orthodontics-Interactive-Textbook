                DEFINITION
            </h3>
            <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200 mb-1">
                Mesio-buccal cusp of the upper first permanent molar is at least one cusp width mesial to the lower first permanent molar. 
                It has two sub-classes or divisions. Division 2 – upper incisors are retroclined with overjet minimal, but may be increased 
                in some cases. At times Class II / 2 appears esthetically pleasing, giving the individual a cute impish look.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200 mb-1">
                Class II / 2 is found in 5% of the population (Todd and Dodd 1975). A study by Houston et al (1993) suggests 10-18% 
                in the British Population.

            <li>“Strap-like” lower lip and high lip line retrocline the maxillary and mandibular incisors creating deep overbite and reduced overjet.</li>
                    <li>As lateral incisors are a bit higher than the central incisors, the lower lip may procline the lateral incisors.</li>
                    <li>Axial inclination of incisors is such that the lower incisor edge is unable to be maintained on the upper incisor crown. Usually a large inter-incisal angle is present creating a deep overbite and reduced overjet.</li>

            <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200 mb-1">
                Usually a Class II skeletal base is present, but can also appear on skeletal Class I or even skeletal Class III base. 
                The cranial base angle can be obtuse leading to mandibular retrognathia. Longer cranial base can produce prognathic maxilla.
                The maxilla is usually short, broad, and placed relatively forward compared to the mandible. 
                The lower face height and MMP angles are reduced, along with reduced gonial angle.

                The Classic feature is a high resting lower lip line due to decreased lower face height. 
                Marked labio-mental fold may be present, along with increased masseteric muscle forces, due to short face height.

                Upper and lower incisors are retroclined with increased interincisal angle.
                Overbite is usually deep and overjet is much reduced. Buccal segments are usually Class II molar relationship. 
                Scissors bite is common in the premolar region. An important feature considered responsible for Class II / 2 maloc-clusion is 
                the crown-root angle, which may be decreased and the incisors may be thin with poorly defined cingulum.

                In crowded cases, relieve crowding with appropriate extractions, followed by level and alignment. 
                Overbite needs to be reduced so as to produce correct edge-centroid relationship, and reduce the interincisal angle. 
                Along with correction of molar relationship to a Class I if it is within limits. The above factors help to ensure stable 
                treatment end results.

                CLEAR ALIGNER THERAPY
            </h3>
            <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-200 mb-1">
                This is especially indicated in young children or during mixed dentition. If the ANB difference is more and 
                the patient is still growing it is best to convert Class II / 2 into Class II / 1 followed by a stage of appropriate 
                functional appliance treatment. At times a third stage with Fixed appliances may also be needed for excellent end results. 
                An anterior bite plane on traditional URA(Upper Removable Appliance) helps to reduce the overbite effectively.
                At the time of writing majority of removable appliances have been superseded by CAT.
