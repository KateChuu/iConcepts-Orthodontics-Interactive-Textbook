                    Mesio-buccal cusp of the first permanent molar is at least one cusp width mesial to the lower first permanent molar.
                    ½ Unit and ¼ unit Class II are also used for more accurate documentation.
                    Incisor classification is such that the lower incisor edge lies posterior to the cingulum plateau.
                    It has two sub-classes or divisions. Division 1 – Overjet is increased, and upper incisors are usually proclined.

                    76% of the cases have a skeletal II base. Some may have a skeletal I base with upper incisors excessively 
                    proclined due to a habit. The cranial base angle (N-S-Ba) may be obtuse, resulting in mandibular retrognathia.
                    In other cases, the cranial base may be long, creating a prognathic maxilla, or a small mandible with 
                    a large maxilla. The face height is usually average or may be reduced.

                    Usually, Class II/1 cases have a short upper lip and excessive overjet, as there is less constraint by the lip musculature.
                    Lip pattern is important for maintaining the final Orthodontic treatment result.
                    With a short upper lip, the overjet reduction is less stable.
                    The lower lip can also contribute to malocclusion by becoming trapped behind upper incisors or causing a lip-tongue seal, creating an increased overjet.

                    The typical features of Class II / 1 are increased overjet, deep and often incomplete overbite. The incisor relationship is 
                    Class II with proclined or average inclination of upper incisors. Buccal segments will have a Class II molar relationship, 
                    most often being ½ unit Class II, though some could be ¼ unit. Crossbites may be present—buccal or lingual.

                    In many Class II / 1 cases, the individual postures the mandible forward habitually, improving lip seal aesthetics, 
                    a temporary condition termed &quot;Sunday Bite.&quot; This well-established postural habit can mislead 
                    the practitioner to believe it is a mild Class II / 1. Diagnosing such a postured position is essential, 
                    evaluating the centric relation, and treating the malocclusion accordingly.

                    The facial growth pattern can be variable. Usually, favorable growth patterns can be expected, but if the mandible rotates 
                    posteriorly, it will not help the buccal segment correction.

                    As the majority of Class II / 1 cases have crowded upper arches, extractions to relieve crowding become essential. 
                    Following extraction, leveling and alignment of the arches with appropriate appliances are carried out, often involving upper 
                    first premolars and lower second premolars bilaterally.

                    Overjet is excessive, which needs to be reduced within the normal range. Deep overbites are
                    corrected to edge centroid relationship i.e. lower incisor edge should lie an-
                    terior to the upper root centroid (Houston 1989). This ensures stable final
                    overbite reduction. Lastly the treatment should aim towards correcting the
                    buccal segment relationship. If a Class I molar relationship is too ambitious
                    to achieve, a functional full unit Class II is also acceptable. ½ and ¼ Unit
                    molar relationships are not functionally stable and should be avoided and/or corrected.
