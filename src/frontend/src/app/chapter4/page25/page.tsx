            Functional appliances work by utilizing functional forces of muscles
            of mastication and facial expression, to bring about favorable
            changes in skeletal and dental relationship mostly in
            antero-posterior dimension, along with vertical and transverse
            corrections as well. Majority are removable, but fixed functional
            appliances are also available.

            History
          </h3>
          <p className="font-sans text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-2 text-justify">
            The first inclined plane was used in the 19th century. Robin&apos;s
            Monobloc was developed in 1902 to prevent glossoptosis in neonates
            suffering from Pierre Robin Syndrome. This appliance was modified by
            Andresen in 1930s, and was used for the first time on his very own
            daughter. She had a mild skeletal II base. Andresen provided her
            with what was later termed as Andresen or Norwegian appliance. With
            night time use only when she went off to summer camp as instructed
            by her Dad, there was a marked improvement in the profile when she
            returned. Thus, this opened a new horizon of improving profiles and
            occlusions through re-education of orofacial musculature. A large
            number of functional appliances were developed thereafter, usually
            named after the originator.

            DIFFERENT TYPES OF FUNCTIONAL APPLIANCES
          </h3>
          <p className="font-sans text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-2 text-justify">
            A large number of functional appliances are available to the
            Orthodontist today. The choice is largely a personal one depending
            upon the preference and familiarity of the specialist, as the mode
            of action of all is very similar apart from a few special
            circumstances. Other factors determining the choice of a functional
            appliance are laboratory facilities, economic constraints and degree
            of compliance of the patient. The following is a list of different
            functional appliances:

            BIOMECHANICS
          </h3>
          <p className="font-sans text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed mb-2 text-justify">
            The functional appliances produce dentoalveolar and skeletal
            modification along with guiding eruption of the dentition and
            improving the soft tissue profile. It is known that the overjet
            reduction in Class II cases occurs primarily due to tipping of
            teeth. The molar relationship is corrected from Class II to Class I
            through guidance of eruption by specific acrylic trimming e.g. in
            Andresen appliance. Perhaps the most important contribution is the
            skeletal modification, which is increased growth rate of the
            retrognathic mandible. Marschner and Harris (1966) saw an increase
            of 1.5mm/year in the mandibular growth in 9-10 year old and 1mm/year
            increase in 10-12 year olds. The mandibular direction of growth can
            be altered principally in the vertical direction. Hence, it is
            particularly beneficial for short faces. Restraint has been found
            difficult and unsuccessful in Class III increased mandibular size
            cases. In maxilla on the other hand restraint is easier to produce,
            but to promote maxillary growth has been unsuccessful. Hence,
            functional appliances are ideal of Class II skeletal malocclusions,
            but not for Class III skeletal cases.
