### ⚙️ Backend

There is no traditional backend server or API in this project.

All data and media assets are stored and managed via [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com), which provides a free, accessible, and GUI-friendly cloud storage solution. This eliminates the need for a custom backend by handling uploads, hosting, and retrieval of assets.

The frontend source code is built with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), offering a fast, serverless environment with built-in backend-like capabilities (e.g. routing, API routes if needed).
