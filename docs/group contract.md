**2. Group Commitments**

In this section, your aim is to come up with shared responses and solutions for managing different obstacles that might arise. This is your main set of contract commitments.

Under key headings, we have provided some examples of potential issues that might arise. Feel free to adjust them and create your own in the spaces provided to suit your group and project. You should make sure to include the obstacles you identified in Part 1.

Write out your approach to addressing each potential issue in the second column.

> When coming up with responses, think about how your values will help you to address these obstacles and reach your destination.
For instance, if your group values fairness, then your responses/solutions may involve issuing a vote to the group on how to resolve an issue.
